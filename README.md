# Technical Writings
A collection of technical documents that I wrote for my projects. Each directory represents a project that required technical reports 
presented to management or my professor.

### Projects
* **Cognitive Science** - a research report on why people procrastinate and how that is related with cognitive science and artifical machines. 
* **Engagement Studio** - a web application used for nurture marketing. The document outlines the technical specifications of the app including the purpose, technologies used, and architecture diagrams.
* **DataImporterPipeline** - technical documentation on a fault tolerant distributed data importer pipeline. Leveraged AWS's S3 and Redshift. Documentation includes schema design for database, class design, and test cases.
* **HackathonListingsDesign** - screenshots of the new UX for every home's listing page on [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com). Idea was implemented at the company hackathon.
