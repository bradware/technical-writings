# Technical Writings
A collection of technical documents that I wrote for my projects. Each directory represents a project that required technical reports 
presented to management or my professor.

### Projects
* **iConfigurator** - a web application I built using the MEAN stack. The document outlines the technical specifications of the app. This includes the API, technologies used, architecture diagrams, and much more.
* **Machine Learning** - a collection of papers written while conducting research and experiments on different topics within machine learning.
* **Cognitive Science** - a research report on why people procrastinate and how that is related with cognitive science and artifical machines. 
* **Engagement Studio** - a web application used for nurture marketing. The document outlines the technical specifications of the app including the purpose, technologies used, and architecture diagrams.
* **Knowledge Based Systems** - technical reports for each phase of the project. These reports served as an analysis for my code which can be found [here](https://github.com/bradware/ravens-progressive-matrices-test). The goal of the project was to teach an artifical agent to solve the Raven's Progressive Matrices problem given only images as input. 
* **DataImporterPipeline** - technical documentation on a fault tolerant distributed data importer pipeline. Leveraged AWS's S3 and Redshift. Documentation includes schema design for database, class design, and test cases.
* **HackathonListingsDesign**
