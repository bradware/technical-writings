# Technical Writings
A collection of technical documentation that I wrote for projects that don't have standalone repositories. Each directory represents a project that required technical reports presented to my manager or professor.

### Projects
* **Cognitive Science** - a research report on why people procrastinate and how that is related with cognitive science and artifical machines.
* **Data Importer Pipeline** - technical documentation on a fault tolerant distributed data importer pipeline. Leveraged AWS's S3 and Redshift. Documentation includes schema design for database, class design, and test cases. Built the pipeline using Java, Hibernate, Guice, and PostGres while I worked for [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com).
* **Engagement Studio** - a web application used for nurture marketing. The document outlines the technical specifications of the app including the purpose, technologies used, and architecture diagrams.
* **Redfin Hackathon UX Design** - screenshots of the new UX for every home's listing page on [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com). Idea was implemented at the company's semi-annual engineering hackathon.
